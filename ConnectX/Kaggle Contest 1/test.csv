It is interesting mostly because it was coded entirely on an iPad in Lua using the Codea application from Two Lives Left.\n\nThe sprites in the game were drawn using Spritely, the sprite editor which comes with Codea.\n\nThe source code for this game and a description of how it was built is available for download at the Codea Tutorial site (http://codeatuts.blogspot.com.au/)\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nThe objective of the game is to clear the grid without tapping any of the mines. If you tap a mine the game is over.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nFrom the menu you can select Easy, Medium or Hard games. The difference in difficulty is determined by the size of the game grid and the number of mines.\n\nEasy - grid dimensions 8x8 with 8 mines\nMedium - grid dimensions 15x15 with 30 mines\nHard - grid dimension 18x18 with 60 mines\n\nThe game screen shows the number of cells not cleared in the top left hand corner and game duration on the right. Tapping on the game grid will reveal either an empty square or a mine.\n\nThe first tap is a gamble. In this version of Minesweeper it is possible for your first tap to be on a mine. Mines are placed randomly in different positions each game. If there are no mines surrounding the cell you tap then all of these cells will also be revealed at the same time. If there is a number in a revealed cell this indicates the number of mines in the surrounding cells. You can use this information to deduce the location of the mines.\n\nMathematically it has been shown that the highest chance of clearing multiple cells is by tapping in a corner.\n\nThere are three buttons on the game screen:\n\nShow/Flag: Tapping the shovel or flag icon at the bottom of the screen will toggle between show and flag mode. In show mode, tapping a cell will reveal it. In flag mode, tapping a cell will place a flag on it, indicating there may be a mine underneath. You don't have to use flags but they make the game easier to solve.\n\nNew: Will reset the grid and start a new game.\n\nMenu: If tapped will take you back to the Menu screen.\n\nHIGHSCORE:\n\nThe high score for each of the three game difficulties is stored. You get a high score by solving the grid in the shortest recorded time.""",Reefwing Software,4+,EN,6858752,Games,"Games, Simulation, Strategy",31/08/2012,14/01/2016

Short episodes and automatic saving mean you can play even when you only have a minute or two. The built-in saga writes down the story for you.

It's now 4am, and I've hardly scratched the surface of the depth of this game. \n\u2022 I now have a fun, engaging, thought provoking RPG on my iPhone, an RPG that fits in my purse and that I can play any time I want, not having to have my computer or Xbox 360 near me to do so. \n\u2022 If Bioware remade Civilization they'd be lucky to end up half as good as King of Dragon Pass.\n\u2022 It's impossible to describe the emotional tug you feel when an old and trusted advisor, who you've watched grow from a young upstart, dies of old age. Or when an exploration team disappears into the wilds, never to be heard from again. Or when a cursed clansman, shunned by his peers, sacrifices himself to stop a raid.

The ball will only flash twice.  The first flash happens when the ball drops and the second flash happens on the line. You\u2019re goal is to tap the screen when you think the ball will appear in the orange target area.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo can famously volley a corner kick in total darkness. The magic behind this remarkable feat is hidden in Cristiano\u2019s brain which enables him to use advance cues to plan upcoming actions. Darkball challenges your brain to do the same, distilling that scenario into its simplest form - intercept a ball in the dark. All you see is all you need.\n\nOne of the brain\u2019s fundamental functions is to use information from the past and present to predict the future. This function is key to how animals, from dragonflies to humans, navigate a dynamic and uncertain world. To make predictions, the brain must have an \u201cinternal model\u201d of the system it interacts with. A basic form of this function is at play when we move our body. For example, to reach for a cup, the brain must have a model to predict how the hand would respond to various motor commands. Internal models are also thought to play a crucial role when we mentally predict future states of the environment, for example when we track a ball as it moves behind another object. Here, we have designed a simple task to understand how the nervous system makes such predictions. In this task, subjects have to intercept a ball when it reaches its final position. By changing the speed of the ball, the intervals when it is invisible, and the target position, we will test various hypotheses about the algorithms that are used to integrate information about past and present to make predictions about future.",CW&T,4+,EN,3293184,Games,"Games, Health & Fitness, Strategy",4/05/2015,13/05/2015

It is highly adaptable and will self-repair by absorbing more liquid Xenoaqua.  The second substance is 'Xenophy', a purple liquid, said to have the consistency of thick syrup.  Xenophy is thought to be the 'brains' inside the Insectron machines and the most vulnerable to damage.  It is unknown if the Insectron think with a' hivemind' or if they feel individuality, but both there is evidence to support both claims.  The Insectrons follow a pack mentality to the point they seem to share their perceptions on the battlefield almost instantaneously, they also display fear and self-survival when in danger.\n\n** Martians: The Holy Gravidus Republic (HGR) **\nHumans first settled on Mars midway into the 22nd century.

Waiting for the perfect moment, the HTR have unleashed the full potential of their technology, wiping aside the Insectron occupation force.

Prepare to say goodbye to pen and paper simplicity, and say hello to TAC!  The rules are familiar, but with an imaginative twist!  This classic puzzle has been expanded and reimagined into a unique and epic variation on an all-ages favorite!\n\nYOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY\nBut you don\u2019t!  TAC is played on a huge 3x3 grid called the Big Board.  Each of the nine squares are actually tic-tac-toe games of their own.  The gameplay in each of these squares, called the Little Boards, is familiar.  Players take turns placing either X\u2019s or O\u2019s in an effort to attain three in a row.\n\nTHE TWIST\nEvery turn is a strategic dance.  Each placement you make on the Little Board determines which square your opponent gets to move to on the Big Board.  You can either gain advantage on the Little Board or force your opponent to play in a certain square.  Move wisely!\n\nSCORE\nThere are two ways to win!  \n1)  Score three in a row on the Big Board!

The Allies must marshal their resources to gain and secure control of as many beaches as they can by day's end: a run-through of the 110-card deck.\n\nHowever, the Axis has the starting advantage; the Allies need to avoid being caught dead in the water. Although most units are preassigned to a beach, each game is won or lost by the placement of cards that provide additional forces or support. Not only is the state of each beach important to consider for these decisions, but also the geography of the coastline - after a beach has been won, the victorious forces can flank adjacent beaches. Both players must always be thinking ahead, looking for ways to best utilise their cards down the line.\n\nKey Features\n\n- Play as the Axis or Allies.\n- Cross-platform online play.\xa0\n- Play solo vs AI.\n- 2 player hot seat multiplayer.\n- A faithful conversion of the original card game.""",HexWar Games Ltd,9+,EN,176006144,Games,"Games, Strategy, Entertainment, Board",13/07/2017,19/07/2017

THE ULTIMATE IPAD STRATEGY GAME : GENESIA LITE !\n\nThis new version of GENESIA is inspired from the game of the same name I created twenty years ago on Amiga 500. GENESIA, named Ultimate Domain in the USA, is a turn based strategic game that received the \xab Tilt d\u2019or \xbb in 1993 for the best strategic game facing the challengers of the time such as \xab Dune 2 \xbb and \xab Starlord \xbb. \n\n100% REWRITTEN WITH OPTIMIZED TOOLS FOR IPAD 2 \n\nGENESIA\u2019s programming has been entirely re-thought and re-written according to Objective C, whilst maintaining the philosophy and original title of the game.  \n\nA \xab BALLSY \xbb GAME DESIGNED FOR PLAYERS HARD TO PLEASE \n\nGENESIA is not an easy game. Contrary to \xab Gameplay \xbb where everything is pre-cooked and where your hand is being held to redirect you every two minutes, here there is no tutorial obligating you to do this or that in order to advance. \n\nIn GENESIA, there are no mind blowing special effects. I preferred to keep my focus on the deepness and interest of the game. \n\nAN \xab OLD FASHIONED \xbb GAME, WITH REAL \xab TURN BASED \xbb BITS IN THEM ! \n\nOne year is divided into four seasons and each season corresponds to one round in the game. In the beginning of each round, little time is given to you to elaborate your strategies and distribute your orders, before passing to your opponent\u2019s hand. \n\nYou can do what you want at any given moment whenever you feel the need to. Being quick or slow isn\u2019t a problem, at any given moment the situations can permute and a well played hand can change the unravelling of the round. A situation that seems completely hopeless to you can, armed with patience and strategy, turn around to your favor. \n\nTACTICAL COMBAT, MANAGEMENT, ADVENTURE AND \xab GEMS \xbb ! \n\nGENESIA isn\u2019t a simple race against time. You will always have several ways to do what must be done, and step by step, you will sharpen your tactics. To achieve victory, you will have to develop your economy\u2019s politics and accumulate resources that will enable you to recruit soldiers to find as fast as you can gems of NEORT. \n\nGENESIA \xab IT\u2019S ALIVE \xbb ! \n\nTo evolve in GENESIA, you will have to act as harmoniously as possible. Several crafts are at your disposal to build this New World : farmers, lumberjacks, blacksmiths, carpenters, soldiers... But all of this won\u2019t be done easily for other Governors are striving just as you, on other territories. It\u2019s your economy\u2019s development, your military force and technological advancement that will lead you to the term of your engagement. \n\nAs in every society, your people aspire to happiness and have their own lives. They work, pay taxes, get married, have children, age... and are even subject to diseases. \n\n\u2022 Flowers favor the presence of pollinating insects, the tree roots stabilize the grounds, and vegetation develops accordingly to the natural environment. \n\u2022 The sea, the rain, the storms, the snow melts, drinking water wells influence the groundwater. \n\u2022 The seasons have a direct impact on the exploitation of the natural resources. \n\nGENESIA IS YOUR GAME, FOR A LONG TIME \n\nThis new version is the first stone to building an empire that we can create together. It will take time and GENESIA will evolve during the following months. I already have dozens of ideas I would like to incorporate to make GENESIA the most complete, interesting turn based strategic game there is. \n\nIN A NUTSHELL \n\n\u2022 A Strategy and Management turn based game in a living world. \n\u2022 Playable, up to three players on the same iPad or against the artificial intelligence. \n\u2022 A procedural universe: two rounds never look alike, for hundreds of hours of gaming. \n\u2022 A deepness and attention to detail unprecedented on iPad : form armies and conquer foreign provinces : soldiers, bowmen, horsemen, champions, bards, cannoneers and hot air balloon pilots are under your commands.

You need 4 goals to win the game.\n\nUsing head phones or ear buds, you hear the puck heading towards you, and you control your mallet by moving your finger left and right.  When the puck is close enough, you'll hear a ding sound, and you can swipe the puck aim at your opponent's goal.\n\nBlindfold Air Hockey comes with a tutorial level, and 16 different opponents - varying from beginner to expert.  \n\nBlindfold Air Hockey was suggested by several blind gamers who enjoyed Blindfold Breakout and Blindfold Bowling.\n\nThe game comes with coins; you need one coin to play.  To get more coins, you can purchase unlimited play.""",marty schultz,4+,EN,15755264,Games,"Games, Strategy, Sports, Sports",12/11/2015,31/03/2019

It has been carefully tuned to play less like a machine and more like a human. At lower levels, it makes blunders of a straightforward kind that are easy to spot, but at higher levels more careful play is required to take advantage of more subtle tactical and even strategic errors. At its highest levels, Primus plays at around 2000 Elo, but even at the very highest levels, it still has occasional simulated lapses of concentration.\n\nThe engine was conceived out of frustration with the overwhelming tactical strength of modern chess engines. Most modern chess engines are so tactically strong that extremely careful defensive and anti-computer play is required to make any progress; in other words, it\'s nothing like playing a human. We wanted to create an engine that allows for a more human, strategic style of play where there\'s room to take advantage of the occasional blunder.\n\nWe\'ve included a mate puzzle generator to create an almost infinite variety of checkmate puzzles that allow you to sharpen your chess instincts, and multiplayer modes that allow you to use your device as a virtual chessboard, or play via bluetooth or wireless with a local opponent.\n\nWe\'ve also added a ""Time Control"" mode, to allow you to play using standard chess time controls, rather than a predefined difficulty level.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Mate puzzle generator - an almost infinite number of puzzles.\n- Two player mode over Bluetooth / Lan.\n- Tabletop mode so you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.\n- Various different boards, pieces and graphical options.\n- Support for all skill levels from total novice to expert.\n- Supports all orientations, so you can make full use of your iPad Smart Case or stand.\n- Supports multitasking, so you can follow along with videos/ebooks.\n- Focus mode, to hide the UI so you can focus on the board.\n- Puzzles and practice levels, so you can practice your endgames or play some interesting challenge levels.\n- Mini-tournament mode - a six-game mini tournament mode for the more serious player.\n- Elo rating estimation from your game results.",DBRG Ltd.,4+,EN,198796288,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Board",8/01/2016,21/11/2017

Score bonuses and multi-bonuses for completing horizontal, vertical or diagonal rows. Complete the board within 8 turns and score a completion bonus & carry your score & unused rolls over to a new board (if playing Continuous mode).\n\nThe objective of Dice Match Bingo is to complete rows of random dice by matching them with the dice rolled at the top of the screen. The ultimate aim is to match every die on the game screen and score a completion bonus. You have 8 turns per game to try and match as many dice as possible. Every die you match scores points at the face value of that die.\n\nRows can be completed vertically, horizontally and diagonally from corner to corner. Every time a row is completed you will score bonus points - 100 for a horizontal row, 150 for a vertical row and 200 for a diagonal row. When you complete more than 1 row simultaneously, you score a 200 point bonus for each row completed in that turn. If you complete the entire grid, you will score a 1000 point bonus plus an additional 1000 points for every roll remaining in the game.\n\nYou earn a Bonus Die for every 10 games you play. Bonus Dice can be used to complete a board when you have 1 unmatched die left after your last roll.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe screen has 6 dice along the top and a grid of 36 dice that are randomly allocated values at the start of the game. Begin by tapping on the Start button to take your first roll of the dice along the top. If the 'Show Match Hints' option in Settings is turned on, any dice on the grid that match any number rolled at the top will be highlighted and can be selected. As you select matches in the grid, your selection and the corresponding rolled die will turn blue. A blue rolled die cannot be used again in the current turn - however you can make it available again by tapping on a selected (blue) match in the grid to deselect it. You can also move a selected match by tapping on any other matched die with the same value. Once you have selected 6 matches in the grid (or less if you rolled a number that doesn't have a corresponding match), tap the Roll button to take your next turn. The dice you selected will change to red to show they are now locked and not available to be selected again. If you completed a row, all the dice in that row will change to green to indicate that the row is complete. In Standard mode, the game ends after 8 turns or if you complete the grid in less than 8 turns.\n\nCONTINUOUS MODE\nIn Continuous mode, if you complete the board your score & any unused rolls are carried over to a new board & the game continues.\n\nTIMED MODE\nTimed mode adds the challenge of only being allowed 6 seconds per turn.

Onitama is somewhat reminiscent of chess and rather addictive with its dynamic game mechanic in which warriors face off so their master may win the game. Concentration and luck are the only weapons you'll have at your disposal! You'll need to fully master mind and body to defeat your opponents.\n\nTHINK STRATEGY! \nEvery opponent has four warriors and one elder at their disposal. The objective is simple: win the battle. To do so, you must either capture your opponent's elder or take their place in the temple arch. The game is easy to play, but you'll need time to become a true master. Although, not really... Onitama is the ideal strategy game for exercising your mind, as you'll have to think ahead about moves! The moves you're allowed to make are determined by five cards which are drawn at random, shown face-up, and shared between players. Each card corresponds to an animal and sets out a specific move that you have to follow. When you play a card, you must place it between you and your opponent and pick up the previously played card, and so on. This way, both players have the exact same chance of winning the game.\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT ANALYSIS\u2026 \nThe key to success in this simple, elegant type of combat is to stay calm and concentrate. The Shrine of Onitama is a sacred ground where foresight is necessary. Animal spirits will guide you on the perilous path and allow you to gain true wisdom. In short, it's an elegant and simple game that captures the essence of martial arts. The game design and calligraphy will make your gaming experience a unique and unforgettable one. \n\nPLAY ON YOUR OWN OR WITH OTHERS\nPlay against the computer on your own, or against your friends.

Build a party of fighters, priests, mages and thieves to run deep into the dungeon.  Test your courage and skill against groups of orcs, trolls, vampires and dragons.\n\nEarning its reputation as the thinking man's dungeon game, Oubliette blends the thrill of mortal combat with the sublime challenges of strategy, planning and adaptation.  Rather than testing your reaction speed and nerves, like a first person shooter, Oubliette challenges the player to do careful strategic planning as well as make tactical decisions in the heat of battle.\n\nEach player (character) in the game is created from one of eight player races, which vary in attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and durability.  Elves are highly intelligent and (potentially) immortal, Orcs are strong with short life spans, Dwarves are strong with high wisdom, Kobolds are quite weak in most areas but advance more quickly.\n\nDepending on these attributes, each player will be qualified to join a limited number of player classes (occupations).  More balanced players will have more choices, including Hirebrand (fighter), Mage, Priest and Thief.  Less commonly, players may be qualified for a highly selective class with special skills such as Ranger, Sage, Paladin, Samurai or Ninja.\n\nUnlike games which focus on a single player against multiple opponents, Oubliette allows a party of up to 10 players with complementary skills to face the various types of monsters found in the dungeon.  There are more than 160 different monsters, and to deal with them, more than 150 different pieces of equipment, which may be enchanted with special properties or skills.\n\nOubliette is challenging, but forgiving.  New players commonly have their parties wiped out by an unfamiliar group of monsters.  In fact, your party can meet up to 3 monster groups at the same time!  Use the Temporal Chamber to save a Temporal Portal before dangerous trips.  If things turn out badly, use the Temporal Chamber to turn back the clock and try again.  The trapeze is every bit as thrilling, but safer, with a net below.\n\nIf you are up to the challenge, Oubliette is free to download and play.  Explore the easier levels of the dungeon to build your party and expertise.  And then, when you are ready, feel the power of the game on the deeper levels.

A single red coin known as the queen has to be pocketed and followed by another carromman, if not it will be returned to the center.

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. Also available in the App Store is a paid version with NO advertising: Pinochle Gold.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team goes out.""",fishdog.net,4+,"DA, NL, EN, FR, DE, NO, SV, TR",50140160,Games,"Games, Strategy, Card, Entertainment",11/02/2010,20/06/2019

They will need somewhere to work so you will also develop commerce and businesses to provide them with employment.   \n\nUnlike Earth, there isn\u2019t a ready supply of resources so you will be responsible for providing power, water and oxygen for your citizens, farming for food and mining for resources.\n\nIt is not all about work though as that will make your population unhappy.  Provide them with city services, leisure and community buildings, parks and decorations to keep your new residents happy and content in their new city.\n\nHappy people will work harder and create more income for you to spend building and improving your city.  Manage transport networks to keep your citizens moving and build spaceports to increase industry and travel.\n\nMANAGE YOUR CITY\nSuitable for all ages and all experience levels, Space City can be played as a regular city builder and you\u2019re completely free to design a fabulous city or you can use the inbuilt advanced analytics to optimize your city - down to an individual building level.\n\nThe more advanced city builders can apply town zoning principles, manage pollution levels, efficiently deploy city services and optimize resources to increase city happiness and maximize city revenue.  Keep it as simple as you like or be a tycoon and micromanage building your city and keeping your people happy; the choice is yours.\n\nDESIGN AND EVOLVE YOUR CITY\nDynamic land generation ensures no two civilizations will ever look the same.

As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game in a tiny download package.\nHearts is trick-taking playing card game for 4 players, no teams and no trump suit. The game is also known as The Dirty, Black Lady, Chase the Lady, Crubs, and Black Maria, though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is regarded as a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game. The object of the game is to avoid taking points. When the first player reaches 100 points, the player with the lowest number of points is the winner.\n\nIn hearts each heart card is worth 1 point and the queen of spades is worth 13 points, which is as much as all of the other cards combined.\nAt the beginning of round, the players choose three cards to pass to a random player. The player with the 2 of clubs must lead the first trick with the 2 of clubs. For each trick a player must follow suit unless he does not have a card of that suit. Because there is no trump, a player can not win a trick if he passes a card of any suit other than the suit lead. Hearts can not be lead until hearts are broken - after the first heart card has been played. If a player takes every point in a round, he \u201cShoots the Moon\u201d and he receives 0 points for the round while all other players receive 26 points.\n\nDon't forget to check our Games section for more fun games...""",GASP Mobile Games Inc,4+,EN,10183680,Games,"Games, Card, Strategy",13/03/2012,3/05/2018

With over 100,000 downloads, Eugene is one of the most popular Chess apps on iTunes. Can you defeat him? Download Eugene now and find out.\n\nHOW SMART IS EUGENE?\nA good chess player should be able to defeat Eugene with a good game. He starts out with a difficulty of 2, but you can increase it to 3 if he isn't challenging you enough. This will slow Eugene down a bit, especially on devices older than iPhone 4.\n\nEugene isn't programmed with any pre-set openings. This makes for some interesting and non-traditional situations right from the start. Obviously, this also means that Eugene might get into trouble early since his vision isn't as deep as other engines that play by the book.\n\nEugene's brains are basically javascript, the language that powers the web. Apple continues to improve the performance of javascript with each new phone so Eugene will continue to get faster.\n\nAn actual rating of Eugene is a bit hard to calculate. If someone would like to calculate his actual ELO that would be awesome and I will update this description accordingly. If I had to estimate it I would guess it is maybe 1600. That is really just a guess, however.""",Adrian3,4+,"EN, DE",4449280,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Board, Strategy",12/02/2011,8/12/2015

They did happen, and they happened often, but they never matched the scale of the Western Theatre.  Starting in China in the 1930's the Chinese engaged the Japanese using Russian T26's and German Panzer I's.  The Japanese fought the Russians in 1939 and 1945, the Soviets with the one of the world's greatest generals, Zhukov, in command!\n\nIn 1941 the French in Vietnam briefly fought the Japanese with World War One era tanks.  In Burma and India, British Commonwealth forces regularly engaged in battle using equipment that would have been considered obsolete on the West Front.   Finally the titanic struggle between the Japanese and United States of American resulted in dozens of tank engagements.\n\nEven the Island War battles saw some engagements with over 30 Japanese tanks in a single mass assault.

Giant sand worms who are ready to absorb and devour anyone who dare to come close enough to its abyssal jaw.

Run away if you see another moving objects like monsters, deadly spiky balls, worm holes, devour DNA of other wild monsters and just collect DNA scattered over the territory. The only way how you can survive is to constantly evolve, acquire new skins, improve parameters of the insect and constantly change the tactic against other insatiable monsters. \n\nDepending on the monster\u2019s evolution stage it can become a tiny weak but very fast monster or, in contrast become a furious, mighty and dangerous monster easily devouring other inhabitants of this tiny universe, showing its power in clashes.

Or maybe you want to harness the electric power and sell it for a profit? Reactor allows you to do that and so much more in one of the most intense and one of a kind strategy games that you have ever played.\nThe premise in Reactor is very simple, you have to create power plants and generate as much electricity and heat as possible all while keeping everything under control and converting it into a lot of money. You will have to start off easy, with the help of small wind turbines that will generate a little electricity, enough to get your business going. \nThen you have to focus on getting stuff like offices and more turbines, solar panels, generators, coal burners, and in the end you will have the ability to create your own reactor, be it a nuclear, thermonuclear or fusion reactor, something that is very important to keep an eye on. Reactors are by far the best if you want a great return on investment but they are also the less stable and you have to manage heat as they can easily become unstable.\nWith more than 10 maps to unlock and play, you will always have your hands full as you will try to figure out the best way to make insane profits and obtain a stellar result. You can play it safe and run a business that brings less but stable amounts of money, or you can check out alternative methods that are riskier but with a better return on investment.\nReactor is an astounding idle game, one that manages to bring in front extraordinary gameplay moments and stunning opportunities. It\u2019s very fun to play and you can easily use it as an idle game, because resource production will take place even as you go away, which is even more exciting. \nIn Reactor you have all the power in your hands and it all comes down to you to make the right choice and take this one of a kind gameplay mechanic to new heights. With incredibly fun gameplay, nice mechanics and interesting choices, Reactor is the ultimate game that you want to play. A sheer combination of strategy, idle gaming and perfect unlock system, Reactor will help you spend your time wisely with amazing moments and a stellar outcome.\nFeatures:\n\u2022\tMultiple buildings to choose from\n\u2022\tA complex game that\u2019s easy to learn and hard to master\n\u2022\tIdling mechanic that allows you to earn resources even if you are offline\n\u2022\tYou have the first map for free, the others need to be unlocked \n\u2022\tMultiple upgrades to choose from\n\u2022\tInteresting gameplay mechanics that you have to keep an eye on at all costs\n\u2022\tStellar research system",Robert Grzybek,4+,EN,127089664,Games,"Games, Simulation, Strategy",4/03/2016,31/05/2019

A vast expanse of world map, scattered with bases of thousands of players and rich resource mines, supports multiple 1v1 or group battles between players at the same time. Collect resources, establish your own fleet, upgrade technologies and dominate the seas! You can also compete with other players in arena or trans-server battles. With your understanding of tactics and flexible strategy, you can lead your fleet to glory! What one needs to do to achieve these goals is very simple and straight-forward, even for those unfamiliar with this game type. You will get a comprehensive initial guidance from the beginning of the game and you can get help whenever you ponder on what to do next. Just click with your fingertips and you can conquer the world! \n\nFeatures: \nExquisite and vivid depiction of warship details makes you feel watching real naval battles right before your eyes!\n\nEvery battle, either against NPC or real player, requires a well-designed tactic, including the choice of warship types and formation positioning. Every little change will make a big difference in the result of the battle: total defeat, victory by narrow margin or total victory!\n\nWith very simple operations, everyone can grasp how to play the game well in a few minutes. You can fight a war with the touch of a few fingers on the palm of one hand!\nA huge world map dotted with player bases and resource mines here and there, supporting 1-on-1 battles or wars between Legions.

Our original attempt at an app for this game was unfortunately less-than-stellar (to be kind). We knew we could do better, and we committed to making it better. Regrettably, it took us a long time - and three different developers - to finally create this new version. But at last we have an app that we are REALLY proud of. We hope you guys will like it, too, and find it a major improvement over the original game.\n\nThis new app update is an entirely new game with 100% new code, so you guys are getting a completely different app from the original. We are providing it as an \u201cupdated version\u201d because that was the only way I could figure out to make sure that the owners of the original could get the new app for free. Please accept this as our apology that the original app wasn\u2019t better, for the time it took us to get you the new version, and as a demonstration of our determination to never leave you stuck with a game that isn\u2019t a quality product.\n\nFor you players who already play the Dominant Species boardgame, this app will allow you to have fun and practice your skills anytime, against a mix of human and computer AI opponents.  \n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with the boardgame, we provide context-sensitive explanations and a set of online rules to help you learn the game and get started quickly. You can also get help from us directly, via our Facebook page - which we are revamping to support the new version - at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dominant-Species-for-iPad/320893411343198. If you want to learn more strategy or have questions about general game play (not app-related), feel free to ask your questions on our Dominant Species page on BoardgameGeek: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62219/dominant-species\n\nHere's an updated feature list. Note that we are working on an additional update which will add multi-player Game Center support.\n\nFeatures:\n\nPlay against a mix of up to 5 human and/or AI opponents via Solo Play, Pass 'N Play,  or a combination of both.\nA completely reworked User Interface that makes the game much easier to play\nNew Pull-Out visual menus that provide quick access to Tile Scoring, Speciation Values, Food Chain, and Dominance Cards.\nAll New Art from the new version of the boardgames\nAI players that are greatly improved from the original version.\nA new Undo feature\nAutosave and Resume Game\nPinch to zoom and scroll\nContext-sensitive help\nColor-coded dominance tracking\n\n\nFinally, I want to personally thank all the great folks at GameTheory, who rewrote the entire app and gave us a product to be proud of. I also want to thank the people who volunteered to help us test Dominant Species, caught many bugs, and gave us great suggestions throughout. You guys did terrific work - thanks!\n\nOK, enough talk. It\u2019s time to play. Enjoy the game!\n\n- Gene""",GMT Games LLC,9+,EN,72065024,Games,"Games, Board, Strategy",17/10/2012,30/09/2015

Most players combine multiple elements in their personal playstyle.\n\nAs a new player, you have a degree of protection from larger players called Noob Protection. During this period, you can attack and be attacked only by other new players of similar rank. As your points increase, you become fair game to more powerful players (and can attack them as well).\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help. The player community is one of the best things about this game. Experienced players will often share advise and offer you some startup resources. You can communicate with individual players in-game or on our chat server, hosted on the Discord chat app (available in your app store/play store).""","Munkeez, LLC",4+,EN,46008320,Games,"Games, Strategy",4/01/2018,31/05/2018

It's quite satisfying, though.\u201c \nJennifer Allen, 148Apps, 4/5 stars\n\n\u201eHow many acronyms can you cram into a single game? Crowntakers is a PDL TBS RPG (that is, a procedural death labyrinth role-playing game with turn-based strategy combat) (\u2026) and it\u2019s really good fun if you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics.\u201c\nMichelle Star, CNET\n\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\nUser Ratings\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\n\n5/5 - If you like turn based tactical medieval rpg's get this. Not as much story/length as final fantasy tactics, but frankly on iDevices I consider that a win. Bite sized battles, winnable in a day on easy, challenging on hard, good replay value. Only crashed once on 1st gen mini\n\n5/5 - This is worth your money. You get a polished game, tactical battles, and thoughtful choices in exploration. Also big points for splitting the game into two difficulties. One being sort of roguelike with permadeath and the other much more RPG without permadeath and with consistent leveling. If you're thinking about this one, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it like I do!\n\n5/5 - This game should get much more hype. I've been playing it non-stop in my free time for over a week. Despite some bugs (which the dev's have been very quick to address), Each game feels quite different with the random locations within areas, random loot and different party builds. It's not easy at first, but learning different strategies as you go is enjoyable. Highly recommend this game!\n\n5/5 - Big fan of this game. The battles are very tactical and the map navigation is really streamlined and fun to explore. This is a good one for any rogue-like fans. It's not super punishing, but it does present a nice challenge on the normal mode (haven't beaten it yet, but I hope a hard mode unlocks after doing so).""",Kalypso Media Group GmbH,12+,"EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, KO, RU, ZH, ES, ZH",693882880,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Strategy",31/03/2015,3/04/2017

Most players either lose interest because it is too easy or feel frustrated because it is too difficult to solve.  \n\nAre you looking for a puzzle game that anyone can play, but still offers plenty to master? Look no further than LONPOS, it is a fantastic award winning game that has received a huge amount of attention around the world.

Playing the LONPOS is like doing a Yoga exercise with your brain.  It tickles your brain with an easy level puzzle that you can solve in a minute.  But don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 it is just a warm up exercise to prepare you for more challenging puzzles ahead.  When you play the more challenging level puzzles, it will give your brain a good stretch for hours, even days.  But when you complete the puzzle, you will feel like a genius with a fantastic sense of achievement and you're ready to move onto the next puzzle.\n\n\nLONPOS consists of 12 building blocks (known as Pentominoes), each unique in shape and color.  Each Pentomino can be rotated in 90\xb0 intervals or can be flipped in 180\xb0 to create a mirror image. Each puzzle revolves around a rectangular game board of 55 spaces. The goal is to place all Pentominoes into the game board to occupy all 55 spaces.  That sounds easy doesn\u2019t it?  Don\u2019t be fooled!

Battle other players online controlling huge space fleets ranging from small fighters to gigantic battlecruisers. Play the single player campaign or train against the AI.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nGalactic Conflict is a competitive SciFi RTS with a gameplay similar to Starcraft or Command & Conquer. You start out on your homeworld, build up your economy to gain valuable resources to research better technology and of course an impressive space fleet. Conquer new planets to expand your influence and increase your income and use your strategic thinking and perfect execution to ultimately defeat your opponents \u2013 either online or against the AI.\n\nGalactic Conflict was explicitly developed for tablets but brings real time strategy on a scale previously unseen on mobile devices. You can literally control hundreds of space ships at the same time. Ships come at all sizes: watch small fighters and corvettes dog-fighting for strikecraft supremacy, bombers swarming enemy ships, frigates hypering in to lay waste to an enemy planet or unleash the tremendous firepower of the huge capital ships.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN\n\nEnjoy the single player campaign where the Terran Confederation\u2019s home planet has been attacked by the mysterious Pyros race without prior notice. Only a small fleet of Terrans could survive the cowardly attack and they are now on the run. Join the terran space fleet in 12 immersive missions, help protect the only survivors of the human race and find the best strategies to repel the invaders.\n\nSKIRMISH AGAINST THE AI\n\nPlay against AI opponents in four different difficulty settings in numerous galaxies to shape up for multiplayer. Experiment with new strategies, learn your preferred race and work on your timings to outsmart the opponent.\n\nINTENSIVE MULTIPLAYER ACTION\n\nChallenge your friends in a 1v1 or 2v2 on Game Center or get automatically matched to other players on the Internet. Let\u2019s face it: nothing beats the excitement of playing real people. This opens up an infinite variety of strategies for endless replayability. Can you gain #1 on the Game Center leaderboards?\n\nGAME BALANCE\n\nGalactic Conflict features two distinct races each having 13 different space ships. It is easy to control on a touch device even for newcomers to strategy games but still provides good strategic depth for real-time strategy fans. We all know that in strategy games, the meta-game shifts as new strategies are discovered by innovative players and this needs continuous small adjustments to the gameplay often referred to as \u201cbalancing the game\u201d.\nThe game was made by experienced, passionate real-time strategy players and as such, we are dedicated to keep the game balanced for the best multiplayer experience.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nWe encourage you to leave feedback on the AppStore so other players know how awesome the game is.

This is a game that would absolutely only work on the iOS platform, and it's hands-down one of the best games on the App Store. It gets my highest recommendation.\n\nADDICTIVE PUZZLES\nHelsing's Fire features a brand-new puzzle mechanic never before seen: use the touch-screen to position Helsing's torch to illuminate different combinations of monsters, then destroy them in the correct order using Raffton's supply of different tonics. The quick, rewarding puzzles make it a perfect game for brief play-sessions, but you'll always want to play 'just one more level'!\n\nA HUGE, DARK UNIVERSE\nWith puzzles set across four worlds, with 30 different levels in each world, all featuring fifteen different monster types including four bosses, Helsing's Fire provides an incredibly\nrich, deep, and varied game experience. And because on replays puzzles are re-generated randomly, the game will always be fresh!\n\nCOMPELLING SETTING\nThe Victorian theme, Gothic setting, and engaging characters make Helsing's Fire one of the most appealing story-oriented puzzle games released. Add to that the distinct minimalist style of the character portraits, the incredible dynamic lighting of the shadows cast by your moving torch, and an original soundtrack, and it's clear that Helsing's Fire presents an epic experience. Designed just for the iPhone, this is high-quality mobile gaming at its finest.\n\nMULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\nAs if the 120 distinct levels weren't enough, Helsing's Fire also comes with additional Endless Survival and Online Bounty modes, for the bravest of the brave! And when you've stood against the horde as long as you can, you can post your scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, earning achievements for your accomplishments and claiming bragging rights from your friends.\n\nDracula must be stopped. Raffton, take the tonics: it's time to head into the Blight!""",3909,9+,"ZH, EN, JA",29290496,Games,"Games, Puzzle, Entertainment, Strategy",15/12/2010,16/03/2017

Includes randomly generated puzzles for infinite replay value! \n\nHow To Play \n--------------- \nThe goal of a nonogram puzzle is to ""fill"" all the correct blocks in a grid. The key to solving each puzzle is the numbers on the top and left of the grid. Each number gives you a clue about how many blocks are filled in each row or column. For example, if the clue for a row was ""4 3 1"", that means there are four sequentially filled blocks, a gap of one (or more), three filled blocks, another gap, and then finally one filled block on its own. In a 10x10 puzzle grid, this clue solves the whole row: 4 filled + 1 blank + 3 filled + 1 blank + 1 filled = 10 total. Solve easy clues first, then you can logically fill in the rest of the blocks in the grid.

You start out with quiescence of the elements, but you have to change faith to your advantage. You need a good strategy to break the quiescence \nto your advantage. But be careful, your opponent will try the same thing and you might end up loosing most of you Taijitu pieces that symbolize your faith. \n\n- Yin and Yang takes place between two players. The first player symbolizes the Yin, the second player symbolizes the Yang \n\n-It is played on an 8x8 board of 64 squares. There are 64 Taijitu pieces, colored black for player representing Yin and gold for the player representing Yang. \n\n- In the basic game, the board is set up initially with two Taijitu pieces for each player. The advanced games (Challenge and Master) have more pieces on the initial board) \n\n- Yang (black Taijitu) makes the first moved. Players are then taking alternate turns. \n\n- When making your move, you can change faith by forcing pieces on the board to change from Yin to Yang or Yang to Yin. \n\n- Goal of the game is, once all the pieces are placed to have more pieces than your opponent on the board. \n\n- At each turn a player must place a Taijitu piece with their color face up on one of the empty squares of the board, adjacent to an opponent's Taijitu piece, such that one or \nmore straight lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) are formed from the newly placed disc, through one or more of the opponent's discs and up to other Taijitu pieces of their own color already \non the board. All the intervening Taijitu pieces of the opponent's color are flipped to the faith (Yin/Yang) of the newly laid Taijitu piece. \n\n-Taijitu pieces may be flipped from one faith to the other but once played are not moved from one square to another or removed from the board. \n\n- Players may not pass unless there is no valid move available to them in which case they must pass. \n\n-Play continues until neither player is able to move, usually when all 64 squares have been played. \n\n- The player with most piece of their faith wins \n\n\nHistory \n\nIn Chinese philosophy, the concept of yin yang, normally \nreferred to in the West as yin and yang) is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other \nin turn. The concept lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of \ndifferent forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, taijiquan (tai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung) and of I Ching divination. Many natural dualities \u2014 e.g. dark and light, \nfemale and male, low and high, cold and hot \u2014 are thought of as manifestations of yin and yang (respectively). \nYin yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly \nin particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. The concept of yin and yang is often symbolized by various forms of the Taijitu symbol, for which it is probably best known in western cultures. \nThere is a perception (especially in the West) that yin and yang correspond to good and evil (not respectively). However, Taoist philosophy generally discounts good/bad distinctions and other \ndichotomous moral judgments, in preference to the idea of balance. Confucianism (most notably the philosophy of D. Zhongshu, circa the second century BCE) did attach a moral dimension to the idea \nof yin and yang, but the modern sense of the term largely stems from Buddhist adaptations of Taoist philosophy. \n\n---------------------- \nThis game is enabled for GameCenter and allows you to play against other players through GameCenter.""",Uwe Meier,4+,EN,24873984,Games,"Games, Board, Strategy",14/12/2010,10/11/2017

Two worlds with  60 different levels. 120 levels in total! Each world contains several mines with varied and interesting powers (explosive mine, freezing mine, ticking mine, bubble mine,...)\n\nIn this minesweeper puzzles, you have several levels and it\'s a great challenge to find all the mines ! \n\nTo clear a mine, simply touch and hold your finger on the tile that you think to be a mine. To win, you can also break all the other tiles, avoiding mines. Each land contains the explosive mine and a specific mine.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS WORLDS\n-------------------------------------\nClimb around the ""Upside-down"" world and visit the four lands:\n- The jungle and greenery mines\n- The icy world and freezing mines\n- The pink world and the lost memory mines\n- The dark world and ticking mines\n\nNavigate underwater without having to end the first world:\n- The kingdom of the giant crab and bubble mines\n- The sleeping octopus with mini octopus mines\n- The secretive clams\n- The white explosing mines\n\nREWARDS\n--------------------\nGet each day reward of gold bars or power! You can also get free gold bars by watching a video. You can also get free gold bars watching a video.\n\nAt each achievement you do, you receive free gold bars (eg first level, 5th level, 3 straight victory ...)\n\nAIDS\n-------------------------\nDuring the game, with the gold bars, you can use helpers (at the bottom left of the game screen). These aids are really useful when you are stranded in the game. The aids are filled automatically when you pop free squares.\n\nThe first aid targets a free space and pop it. The second puts some magic powder on several free tiles that you can pop safely. The last and most powerful displays for a few seconds the location of all mines.\n\nTUTORIAL:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nA tutorial is available to help you to understand how to play. Bellow a detailed explanation of the minesweeper game:\n\nThe goal is to clear a minefield without detonating the mines. You see first a grid of identical squares. Some random and unknown squares contain a mine.\n\nThe game is played by revealing squares of the grid by touching them with your finger. \n\nIf a square containing a black mine is revealed, you lose the game. If a square containing a special mine is revealed, the mine explodes and handicaps are added to the grid, for example, filling the already discovered squares.\n\nIf a free square is revealed, a number appears in this square with the number of adjacent squares that contain mines. If this number is zero then the square appears empty, and the surrounding squares are automatically revealed. Using logic, you can in many case use these numbers to deduce the locations of mines or free squares. In case of mine, you can protect the square and capture a mine by adding a flag with a long touch on the screen.\n\nThe game is won when all squares containing mines are located and protected with a flag. In this case, the unrevealed squares are automatically revealed and the next level unlocked.\n\nThe game contains many levels in different worlds. The first levels are easy, but the difficulty increases gradually as the game advances. Each world contains a different special mine. A grid contains black mines, special mines or both.\n\nMoreover you have a limited number of moves available to find all the mines. \n\nIf you have no more live, you can invite Facebook friends to play and you receive a life back! Go in option Menu to use the invite button, or wait to have 0 life.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch , you can play Minesweeper on!

Control mighty battle ship turrets and try to defeat the other captian. You have to sink the oponens battleship by bombing it with rockets and missiles. Both players play on the same device against each other. If there is just one player this player could play against a computer controlled enemy.\n\nGameplay and controls:\nOn a playround two oponens face each others battleships. Each battleship has four turrets. At the beginning these canons are normal canons, but can be specialized and upgraded during the game. The turrets swing on a 90 degrees angle by themselves. The player can fire a canon by touching it. A fired canon needs to cool down for three seconds (greyed out). To hit the enemys battleship the player has to time the touching to lunch missiles to the right direction. Rockets can be catched and stopped by other rockets. If two rockets collide that player gets some gamecash the side the collision happened on. Players can buy turret upgrades from this gamecash every 60seconds (end of playround) on a special upgrade menu. If a player brings the lifebar of the enemy to zero the battleship explodes and the player wins.\n\nUpgrades:\nEach normal canon can be upgraded to one of four special turret systems. Once chosen these upgrades can't be removed or downgraded. Specialized canons can be upgraded two times to a higher level within their kind.\n\nHEAT: The heat canon is a pure defence weapon that can't damage the enemys battleship. Instead of rockets this turret sends out a special heat wave that can destroy multiple missiles.\n\nMINI: The mini-gun canon lunches normal rockets but has a lowered cool down time. This makes it possible to cause a real rainshower of bombs on the highest upgrade level.\n\nSTUN: The stun canon fires eletric bolts instead of missiles. These can't damage the enemys battleship but can disable enemy turrets for a while instead.\n\nCLUST: The cluster canon lunches special rockets that split up on their way to multiple normal missiles and causing therefor a lot of damage.\n\nTORPEDO: The torpedo canon fires torpedos that go under water. They can't be stopped or bounced. \n\nBOUNCE: The bounce canon fires a shockwave that bounces back all normal missiles.\n\n--\nMade in Berlin, Germany""",Marco Kehler,9+,EN,17678336,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy, Entertainment",6/09/2014,9/04/2015

Although its offensive power was extremely high, the defensive ability was poor. \n\nSince no one knew how to utilize this war potential at that time, there might be \nvarious possibilities in the short term.\n\nAs a commander of the air craft carrier task force, make strategic decisions and lead your task force to the victory.\n\nIn this game, you will play the following important roles in the every layer.\n\n 1) Commander of aircraft carrier task force  - Make a Decision\n 2) Captain of aircraft carrier  \u2013 Maneuver your aircraft carrier \n 3) Pilot of Search Plane \u2013 Search Enemy\u2019s aircraft task force\n 4) Leader of Torpedo Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by torpedoes\n 5) Leader of Bomber Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by dive bombs\n 6) Leader of Intercept Fighter Group \u2013 Intercept enemy attack group\n\n1. Features\n\n 1) Every event is realized in the Real-Time simulation.\n 2) Player plays important roles in every layer.\n 3) There are many functions for shorten game time. \n 4) Tutorial Battle is avairable.\n\n2.

Major changes\n\nFor making this game more interesting, following items are modified from the real feature.\n\n 1) New aircraft carrier can be revived easily.\n 2) Aircraft on aircraft carrier is always fully carried when the carrier joins the battle.\n 3) New technologies like Rader, VT-fuse, Break-Code, etc, are not introduced.\n 4) The difference of the ability such as carriers, aircrafts, etc is not considered.\n\n4.

Both options are always available. \n* Straightforward move correction. \n* Review moves with single move buttons or the live position slider to quickly find critical positions for review after the game. You can also use a swipe gesture to review moves.\n* iPad users can display the notation while entering moves. \n* Options to check for legal moves and positions.\n* Adjust your screen brightness from the board view with swipe gestures. \n* Print a scoresheet with a position diagram to an AirPrint printer.\n* Option to include the time spent on each move in the scoresheet or PGN. \n* Localization for English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish. \n* Option for long (Ng1-e2) or short (Nge2) notation.\n* Option for Figurine algebraic notation or Standard algebraic notation (Nf3) .\n\nChess Score Pad is an electronic scoresheet to record your moves during a chess game.

The strategy game features unique hand drawn map, complex morale, innovative controls and smart AI. \n\nUltimate general: Gettysburg is a critically acclaimed indie wargame with one of the highest user ratings for strategy games on Steam and Metacritic. \n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n==============\n\n**Campaign\nThe campaign is split into 10 historical missions from the first engagements to the famous \u201cPickett\u2019s charge\u201d. Missions present different levels of complexity that will give you hours of gameplay. \n\n**Unique Controls & Unit Self-Awareness\nThe game plays in real time, but you can pause at any time to plan your strategy and give orders to units. Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces as if you are drawing them on the tactical map. Units do not need micromanagement, able to act on their own: re-aligning, switching targets, withdrawing and forming battle lines without player input.\n\n**Smart AI \nThe AI commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting to your actions; fighting aggressively or defensively replicating actions of a competent human player. The game will provide the significant challenge on higher difficulty levels.\n\n**Detailed Map of Gettysburg\nWe used satellite images and historical maps, recreating important locations, houses, ridges and hills that are depicted as accurately as possible within the game\u2019s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, but also you will be able to use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game.\n \n**Advanced Line of Sight\nElevation and obstructions will affect unit visibility realistically. Units will use concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware \u2013 the AI will attempt to do the same. \n \n**Tactics matter\nIn Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not \u201cmachines\u201d that blindly follow orders, but need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected from a strategy game is important for winning battles. Unite morale is affected by multiple factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue.\n \n**Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders\nUltimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Command famous brigades like the Iron Brigade, Louisiana Tigers, 1st Vermont, Bucktail Brigade, Gibraltar Brigade, Excelsior Brigade and many more.\n\n**Differences with the PC version\nThe game was redesigned from the ground up to provide good usability and playability on tablets. If you have played the game on the PC, the major change is in the campaign flow and in the user interface. The tactical combat and its features were tuned only slightly. You will be able to experience the same depth and challenge on iPad. \n\nRetina display ready",Game Labs LLC,9+,EN,293021696,Games,"Games, Strategy, Simulation",21/02/2015,24/06/2017

You will have to fight various enemies and monsters, explore new territories, manage economic and scientific developments and solve a heap of unusual and unexpected tasks.

You are able to issue orders but heroes will follow your commands only for a sizeable reward. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" contains elements of role play: while fulfilling your orders, the heroes improve their skills and talents, as well as earn cash to be spent on new equipment, weapons, and magical elixirs. \n\n""Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim"" \u2013 the throne is waiting for its hero! \n\nGame Features: \n\n- Legendary indirect control strategy totally adapted for iOS. \n- 10 types of heroes with dozens of statistics, weapons and armour. \n- A dozen types of monsters. \n- Several dozen spells. \n- 30 upgradeable building types. \n- 15 scenario missions+ a bonus one. \n- 3 difficulty levels. \n- About 100 game achievements. \n______________________________________ \n\n***** ""...Richest real-time strategy game I\u2019ve yet played on a phone or tablet, and also one of the more interesting games of this sort I have played on any system recently."" \u2013 The New York Time \n\n***** ""It\u2019s a great strategy game.

The rich camel hears him, meets him and finds out they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy, ""by Fortune and Fate"", in the course of seven amazing voyages... \n \nThe First Voyage - Sinbad sets to sea to find a fortune. After finding a lot of diamonds on different islands during his first voyage, he lands on an island that  proves to be a gigantic sleeping whale. After being awaken, the whale pulls Sinbad into the water.  Sinbad struggles to keep afloat and needs your help.  HINT: To help Sinbad come back safely home find the harpoon to  stay on whales back! \n \nThe Second Voyage - Sinbad is restless and sets to the sea again. He leaves his ship and finds himself stranded in an deep island valley populated by birds called Rocs and their just hatched eggs. The valley is also full of diamonds.   Merchants harvest these diamonds by throwing huge chunks of meat into the valley which rolls down the steep  walls, picking up the diamonds as they roll to the bottom.  The Rocs pickup the meat rolled in diamonds and bring it back to their nests to feed their young.. Sinbad wants to use this to get out of the valley.  HINT: To help Sinbad become rescued, find a chunk of meat to strap on his back and get carried to the nest!\n \nThe Third Voyage - Adventure calls and Sinbad sets to sea for a third time. He finds himself on the island and captured by ""a huge creature in the likeness of a man, black of color, ... "" He needs a weapon to free himself from the creature.  HINT: To help Sinbad escape, find a sword to blind the creature with!\n \nThe Fourth Voyage - Sinbad sets sails again. He finds himself trapped in an underground cavern of one of the islands. He needs your help to escape.  HINT: Find a map to help Sinbad find a way out of the cavern!\n \nThe Fifth Voyage - Seized with the longing to travel, Sinbad starts his fifth journey. In this adventure, Sinbad is enslaved by the Old Man of the Sea, who rides on his shoulders with his legs twisted round Sinbad\'s neck and will not let go. The only way to free Sinbad is to distract the Old Man of the Sea.  HINT: Find a wine goblets to help Sinbad trick  the Old Man into drinking some and escape!\n \nThe Sixth Voyage - Yearning for another travel, Sinbad, on his sixth voyage, finds himself cast on a desolate river shore. In order to escape this desolate shore, Sinbad must leave the shore via raft.  HINT: Find a knife to help Sinbad construct a raft and float down the river to the nearest city.\n \nThe Seventh Voyage - The sea calls to Sinbad and he answers one more time. This time he gets set down on a mountain-top by bird-people existing on one of the islands. The only way off the mountain top is to scale down its steep cliffs.  HINT: To get Sinbad safely home find a rope to get him down of the mountain.\n\n*** Features***\n\nAmazing 3D graphics and 7 levels of play.\n3 different power ups: SKATEBOARD - to speed up Sinbad, HOURGLASS - to add time to finish the voyage and KEY to help you unlock parts of the maze if you can\'t find way out.\nRandomly generated maps, so each game is never the same.\nMultiplayer game mode for iPhone and iPad that allows you to play against people all over the world.\nUniversal game, works on iPhone, iPod and iPad.\n\n*** Transport yourself in the world of Sinbad, BECOME THE VOYAGER, download now! ***","Excel Heritage Group, Inc.",4+,EN,19804535,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Racing",3/02/2012,20/02/2013

Remember what you have learnt about surviving a zombie disaster and guide your people in this post-apocalyptic adventure.\n\nThe world as we know it no longer exists; now it is time to create a new one. It won\u2019t be easy! The zombies are a true plague. They\u2019re not very smart, but they\u2019re everywhere, and they are legion.\n\nBuild your own shelter and make it safe. Find survivors and convince them to join you. Together you will be able to improve the shelter and create a new home. Those will be the first steps towards building a new civilization, a new zombie-free world for humans.\n\nBut the road to survival is filled with danger. There are no governments, no authorities: anarchy reigns over the world. Survival not only depends on staying away from the zombies, you must also defend your shelter from bandits and thieves. Other survivors have built shelters too, and they see you as a threat. In this post-apocalyptic world, every new settlement that is discovered is considered a threat and treated like a dangerous enemy. Trust is no longer the order of the day \u2013 it is an exception.\n\nDEFEAT THE PLAGUE\nLead your squad against the zombie hordes and defeat the undead. Attack their gathering points and collect resources to help your people. Victory in the war against the undead lies in your hands.\n\n\nFIGHT FOR SURVIVAL\nAttack other settlements to survive. Study their defenses, prepare your team, and develop the right strategy to get inside other shelters to steal their resources.\n\nDEFEND WHAT IS YOURS\nTrain your team to defend your base and configure a defensive system to protect it from the zombies. But do not underestimate survivors! Humans from other settlements will try to plunder your shelter.\n\nRECRUIT SURVIVORS\nFind isolated people, and together build a safe place to live, far from zombies and bandits. Assign them roles in the shelter and ask for their help while you leave to collect resources. Turn survivors into heroes in the war against zombies.\n\nNEGOTIATE WITH OTHER SETTLEMENTS\nEveryone is an enemy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way forever. Contact other refugees and create alliances with them. Building a new world is a tough proposition: you\u2019ll need to negotiate with other shelters to succeed.\n\nBUILD THE BEST SHELTER\nThe world has come to an end, but that doesn\u2019t mean survivors should live badly. Manage your shelter, improve it to make space for more survivors, add entertainment zones and farming areas. Grow crops, recycle materials, and establish a self-sufficient community.\n\nTAKE THE SURVIVORS INTO THE REAL WORLD\n\nUse the Augmented Reality feature to bring the survivors into the real world. See how they look in the street or in your home, and take a photo with them.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Build your shelter from scratch and defend it from zombies and other survivors\n- Attack other shelters to get more resources\n- Player Vs. Player modes\n- Recruit survivors and create a powerful anti-zombie squad\n- Chat with other players\n- All game modes can be played for free\n- Sign in to your Game Center account to save your progress\n- Optimized for iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone \n- The Augmented Reality feature is exclusive for iOS devices.
